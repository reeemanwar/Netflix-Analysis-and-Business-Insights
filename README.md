##  Key Insights  

- **Quality over Quantity:** Shows with more seasons receive higher IMDb ratings, which correlates with user satisfaction and retention.  
- **Genre-Specific Strategies:** Different genres perform better with different season lengths. Example: Korean dramas peak with fewer seasons, while Docuseries and Classic/Cult shows benefit from longer runs.  
- **Business Impact:** Better retention → fewer cancellations → higher lifetime revenue per customer.
